AgentKit by Coinbase Developer Platform allows anyone to give their AI agents access to a crypto wallet and onchain interactions with a comprehensive set of actions and plug-and-play integrations with top frameworks. Allow your agents to send USDC fee-free, deploy custom smart contracts and tokens, or interact in the wide world of DeFi.
CDP SDK is a powerful tool for programmatic blockchain access through easy-to-use APIs. It allows builders to create onchain applications without worrying about the intricacies of blockchain development.
Onramp allows you to easily onboard fiat into crypto using Apple Pay and common payment mechanisms, while Coinbase Commerces lets merchants easily accept crypto.
Use the MPC Wallet APIs to create programmable, secure, and powerful experiences that abstract wallet interaction away from users, perform complex orchestration tasks, and facilitate onchain AI agent execution.

Agent that performs day-to-day tasks for you
Completely abstract away crypto using natural language
Qualification Requirements
Having a working demo that is ideally publicly accessible to be eligible for this prize

ü§ñ AgentKit Pool Prize ‚∏∫ $3,000
Split evenly between all qualifying projects
We believe AgentKit is the best way to give every AI agent, regardless of its framework, model, or structure, access to a crypto wallet and onchain interactions.
Similarly, any protocols or builders who add their actions to the AgentKit repo get the opportunity to be at the forefront of the agentic crypto wave, and offer their protocols a new distribution and interaction paradigm. Instead of users having to manually find their site, they can interact with an agent using natural language with simple terms, completely abstracting away the complex user experience.
Build one of these agents and show us that we're right!
Qualification Requirements
Build with AgentKit in a meaningful way for the Agentic Ethereum hackathon to be eligible

üí∏ Agentic Payments Prize ‚∏∫ $1,500
Build the future of programmatic/agentic payments by integrating with Coinbase Commerce and/or Coinbase Onramp.
